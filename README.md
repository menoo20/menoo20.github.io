Project's Title:
##################################################
Restaurant website clone with some added features.

Project's Description:

The website is html/css clone for a bootstrapmade project. Actually it does have mostly everything
they have done but the thing is i have made it all using only css. 

#I didn't use any other technology and had to write about 1500 lines of css and the purpose was to dive deep
in the vanilla css codes without using libraries like the one the real site is already using.

#That helped me a lot gain a past experience with how the things are actually made and that make using libraries
more easier and digestable for a real programmer adn not just a tool that hides inefficiency of how things are made.


# I could use all the libraries provided by the original version but i prefer to do that in another git hub branch
of my repo. This will help me check the progress happens to the website once i implement a new tech.

Table of Contents:
##################################################
the site contains a single page that consists of about 11 section. 
if i used react in the future i may split them in different routes showing only the navigated section.

the client folder has only one html file which has all the content of the page.
the styles file has all the css files splitted for each section.

##################################################
